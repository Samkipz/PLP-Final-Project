# PLP-Final-Project
# Problem
The traditional manual method of searching or marketing rental houses is an outdated practice in this digital era. This method is faulty since, for the individuals seeking accommodation, it involves moving from one area to another to find suitable accommodation, which can be tedious and wastes a considerable amount of time. Also, individuals seeking accommodation find it challenging to acquire physical addresses about a particular rental or contact information of those in charge of the rentals. For rental owners, this traditional method falls short in marketing strategy. Rental owners find it difficult to advertise the features offered by their rental houses in a system that does not tap into a broader market, such as that provided by an established online presence. And finally, the manual strategy of managing rentals does not provide a platform where tenants can give open feedback that can be publicly accessed by individuals seeking accommodation.

# Purpose
This project aims to develop an online-based system that allows individuals to search for available accommodation in a given village in Trans Nzoia county, and, based on criteria specified by rental owners; they can book it in advance or contact the owners for further information.

# Project Setup

- On opening the application, the user is first prompted to select the location he needs to find a rental. The application uses the intelligent “chained select” to reduce the margin of error in guiding the user. The user can select only villages that belong to a particular ward and wards that belong to a specific constituency. Future releases hope to incorporate geo-location and mapping to find the location the user needs.
